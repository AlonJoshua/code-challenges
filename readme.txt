# Code Challenges Project

Welcome to the Code Challenges Project! This repository contains a collection of coding challenges designed to improve problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.

## Project Structure

- Each challenge is organized into its own folder.
- Each folder contains:
  - A problem description file - problem.ts
  - A test file with the test cases - problem.test.ts
  - A solution file - solution.ts

## How to Use

1. Run 'npm i' to install the necessary dependencies.
2. Navigate to the folder of the challenge you want to work on.
3. Read the problem description 'problem.ts' file.
4. Uncomment the exported function in the same file, and write your code inside.
5. Run 'npm run test' to check if you passed all the test cases for the problem.
6. Use 'solution.ts' to learn about brute force solution and the optimal solution for the problem.
